   I am LaCarra aslo known as Lala or just simply Carra. I'm very out going and hard working. I love working with others. There's a list of things I want to achive in life.
 There's always time to try something new. So with that mindest brouhgt me to this program. Before I joined Girls Who Code for summer 2017 I had no idea what coding was. Honestly
 I didn't know where coding started. So before I came I researched to kind of have an idea of what I will be doing. Doing research I wanted to back out before I got myself into something 
 into something I just thought was impossible. Made me very nervous because I didn't want to be the only one in the group completely lost. I knew I was walking into something very different 
 and new from what I am use to doing. However, my mother reminded me I have joined already so giving up wasn't an option. I had to overcome my worries and just try this. June 5, 2017 was the 
 first day of Girls Who Code. They welcomed me in and made me comfortable. Turns out everyone was new to this also. I've meet new friends that have very different personalities but all are so 
 unique. The three teachers that are teaching us computer science are so patient with us. Scout, Sejal, and Steph are kind and will that the time to come to you presonally just to make sure you 
 really understand before moving on. I don't they notice all their names start with an S which together stands for Super Smart Supporters. </p>
