   I am LaCarra aslo known as Lala or just simply Carra. I'm very out going and hard working. I love working with others.
  There's a list of things I want to achive in life. There's always time to try something new. So with that mindest brouhgt
  me to this program. Before I joined Girls Who Code for summer of 2017 I had no idea what coding was. Honestly I didn't know
  where coding started. So before I came I researched coding to kind of have an idea of what I will be doing. Doing research I wanted
  to back out before I got myself into something I just thought was impossible. This made me very nervous because I
  didn't want to be the only one in the group completely lost. I knew I was walking into something very different and new from 
  what I am use to doing. However, my mother reminded me I have joined already so giving up wasn't an option. I had to overcome 
  my worries and just try this. June 5, 2017 was the first day of Girls Who Code. They welcomed me in and made me comfortable.
  Turns out everyone was new to computer science also. I've meet new friends that have very different personalities but all are so unique.
  The three teachers that are teaching us computer science are so patient with us. Scout, Sejal, and Steph are kind and will take
  the time to come to you presonally just to make sure you really understand before moving on. I don't know if they notice all their names
  start with an S which together stands for Super Smart Supporters.This program opens new paths for me to reconsider as an future career.
